## 🔍 Known Issues & Warnings

### ESLint Warnings
- Multiple unused variables and imports (non-blocking)
- Some `any` types that could be more specific
- Unescaped entities in JSX

### Recommendations
1. Clean up unused imports and variables
2. Replace `any` types with specific types
3. Fix unescaped entities in JSX
4. Consider adding unit tests
5. Implement API rate limiting
6. Add database connection pooling
7. Configure CDN for static assets

## 📈 Next Steps
